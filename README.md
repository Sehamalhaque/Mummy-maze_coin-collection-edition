# Mummy - Coin Collection Game

Navigate the mummy through a challenging maze to collect coins while avoiding deadly traps and a roaming enemy. Built using Python and OpenGL, this game combines smooth grid-based and diagonal movement, dynamic hazards, and escalating levels for a fun arcade-style experience.

## Features

- **Grid-based Movement with Diagonal Support:** Move the mummy smoothly in all 8 directions.
- **Random Enemy Movement:** A red mummy moves randomly, creating unpredictable danger.
- **Collectible Coins:** Gather blue coins scattered across the maze to earn points.
- **Death Zones:** Green/red flashing tiles that cause an instant restart if touched.
- **Level Progression:** Difficulty increases as you collect more coins (more death zones appear).
- **Maze Walls:** Fixed black walls block movement, forcing players to plan routes.
- **Pause and Restart:** Clickable buttons to pause, restart, or exit the game at any time.
- **Keyboard & Mouse Input:** Move with **W, A, S, D** (including diagonals with key combos); use mouse for UI controls.
- **Smooth Animations:** Smooth rendering for player and enemy movement.
- **Cross-platform Compatibility:** Works on any system with Python and PyOpenGL installed.
